# FairIndexSolution
	Finds fair index of two arrays. Fair index means an index that means gives same calculation result in both of arrays. 
	Input: 
	[4,-1,0,3] [-2,5,0,3]
	Output: 
	2
	Because if fair index is 2, in first array 4 + (-1) = 0 + 3, in second array -2 + 5 = 0 + 3.
	If fair index is 3, in first array 4 + (-1) + 0 = 3, in second array -2 + 5 + 0 = 3
